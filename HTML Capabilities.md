# HTML Capabilities

## Troubleshooting and Debugging HTML Code

One of the first and most powerful tools you can use to debug HTML and CSS is the browser's built-in developer tools or DevTools. DevTools allow you to inspect the structure, style, and behavior of your web pages in real time.

## HTML Attributes

offers additional capabilities through attributes, which add power to any element. We have already explored one attribute when discussing the time element. Keep in mind that certain attributes are specific to particular elements, such as the daytime attribute, which we only use with the time element. On the other hand, some attributes work with multiple elements but not all of them. We will delve into some examples of these attributes when we study im

#### The class attribute 

<p class="intro">This is my introduction</p>

#### The class and id attribute

<p class="intro" id="article-ntro"> This is my introduction </p>

The above atrributes class and id are global attributes that can be accessed globally.

#### more global attributes

<html lang="US-ENG" dir="root"></html>

## ARIA Roles

RIA roles provide semantic meaning to content, allowing screen readers and other tools to present and support interaction with an object in a way that is consistent with user expectations of that type of object. 

##### Button

<button aria-pressed=true>...</button>


## Formatting HTML

HTML Formatting is a process of formatting text for better look and feel. HTML provides us ability to format text without using CSS. There are many formatting tags in HTML. These tags are used to make text bold, italicized, or underlined.

<p><b>This text is bold</b></p>

<p><i>This text is italic</i></p>

<p>This is some normal text.</p>

<p><small>This is some smaller text.</small></p>
