# Introduction to HTML

## What is HTML?

### 
HTML short for HyperText Markup Language forms the foundation of website and web app development. It serves as a channel for different types of content like words, images, videos, audio, forms, and interactive experiences. It is the language that allows you to make sure your content is understandable to both people and computers.

HTML has a straightforward structure without any programming logic, loops, or functions. It is known as a declarative language. The code simply declares instructions like "This is a paragraph!" or "Make this a link!" or "Put a form field here!". It is all about using the right vocabulary and making declarations.
