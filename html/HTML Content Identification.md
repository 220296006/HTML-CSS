# HTML Content Identification

## HTML Language Support 

The internet is worldwide, and people speak various languages. In HTML, there are tools to indicate the language of your content. By setting things up correctly, search engines will understand which language websites are in. Spell checkers will provide the appropriate dictionaries, and when a browser reads the content aloud, it will pronounce the words correctly. It is important for computers to know the language of the content it is processing.


<html lang="US">
<html lang="eng-gb">
<html lang="ar" dir="rtl">
<html charset="UTF-8"> 

To specify the charset in HTML, simply include a meta charset tag that equals UTF-8. Place this meta element within the head element on every page of the website, which will be explained further in the chapter eight: HTML Integrations.


## HTML Generic Elements, Div and Span


<div class="myDiv">
  <h2>This is a heading in a div element</h2>
  <p>This is some text in a div element.</p>
</div>
